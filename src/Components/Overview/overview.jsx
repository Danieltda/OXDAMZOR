          OXDAMZOR is created to help people further in their knowledge of
          Ethereum. I came across many useful resources that helped me tremendously. This website is meant to help developers grow in their journey to become an expert in the area of blockchain.

          <br />
          You will find all the resources that I discovered over time. The
          resources will be updated regularly to give developers the latest
          available resources. As the Ethereum space is constantly evolving, more and more amazing tools are built.
